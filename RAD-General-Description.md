**RAD GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

**(European Route Network Improvement Plan - Part 1, Section 8)**

1.  **INTRODUCTION**

    1.  The Route Availability Document (RAD) is created based on:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 255/2010 of 25 March 2010 laying down
    common rules on air traffic flow management, Article 4 - General
    obligations of Member States, paragraph 4; and

b.  COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 123/2019 of 24 January
    2019 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of air
    traffic management (ATM) network functions and repealing Commission
    Regulation (EU) No 677/2011, Annex I - The European Route Network
    Design (ERND) Function, Part B - Planning principle 5(d).

    1.  The RAD is a common reference document containing the policies,
        procedures and description for route and traffic orientation. It
        also includes route network and free route airspace utilisation
        rules and availability.

    2.  The RAD is also an Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management
        (ATFCM) tool that is designed as a sole-source flight-planning
        document, which integrates both structural and ATFCM
        requirements, geographically and vertically.

```
2.  **BASIC PRINCIPLES**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The objective of the RAD is to facilitate flight planning, in order
    to improve ATFCM, while allowing aircraft operators' flight planning
    flexibility. It provides a single, fully integrated and co-ordinated
    routeing scheme. Except where otherwise specified the RAD affects
    all areas where the Network Manager provides ATFCM services.

2.  The RAD enables States/FABs/ANSPs to maximise capacity and reduce
    complexity by defining restrictions that prevent disruption to the
    organised system of major traffic flows through congested areas with
    due regard to Aircraft Operator requirements.

3.  The RAD is designed as a part of the Network Manager (NM) ATFCM
    operation. It is organising the traffic into specific flows to make
    the best use of available capacity. Whilst, on its own, it will not
    guarantee the protection of congested ATC sectors during peak
    periods, it should facilitate more precise application of tactical
    ATFCM measures.

4.  The RAD should also assist the Network Manager in identifying and
    providing re-routeing options. Global management of the demand will,
    potentially, lead to an overall reduction of delays. It is important
    to note that to achieve this, some re-distribution of the traffic
    may be required through the implementation of Scenarios. This may
    result in modified traffic/regulations in some areas where, under
    normal circumstances, they would not be seen.

5.  The content of the RAD shall be agreed between the Network Manager
    and the Operational Stakeholders through an appropriate Cooperative
    Decision Making (CDM) process.

6.  The RAD is subject to continuous review by the Network Manager and
    the Operational Stakeholders to ensure that the requirements are
    still valid and take account of any ATC structural or organisational
    changes that may occur.

7.  The RAD is updated each AIRAC cycle following a structured standard
    process of:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Requirement;

b.  Validation;

c.  Publication by the Network Manager in cooperation/coordination with
    all Operational Stakeholders.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
8.  The RAD is only applicable to the IFR part of the Flight Plan.

9.  Each State shall ensure that the RAD is compatible with their AIP
    with regard to the airspace organisation inside the relevant
    FIR/UIR.

10. The NM is responsible for preparing of a common RAD reference
    document, collating, coordinating, validating and publishing it,
    following the CDM process as described in this section.

2.  **RAD Annex 1 -- Area Definition**

####### This Annex defines a number of aerodromes included in the RAD described by the following terms: {#this-annex-defines-a-number-of-aerodromes-included-in-the-rad-described-by-the-following-terms .unnumbered}

######## "Group" - defines a number of 3 (three) or more aerodromes that may be subject to the same traffic flow rules and/or flight planning facilitation options. For example a major destination may have a number of minor satellite aerodromes in the vicinity; this constitutes a "Group".

######## "Area" - defines as a number of aerodromes within the same region and may comprise several "Groups", or individual aerodromes.

####### The definition of the Group and/or Area, with the exclusion or inclusion of certain aerodromes is the responsibility of the State/FAB/ANSP within which the Group and/or Area exists; however other States/FABs/ANSPs may use the definition. {#the-definition-of-the-group-andor-area-with-the-exclusion-or-inclusion-of-certain-aerodromes-is-the-responsibility-of-the-statefabansp-within-which-the-group-andor-area-exists-however-other-statesfabsansps-may-use-the-definition. .unnumbered}

    point, ATS route segment, defined DCT, airspace volume (ATC Unit,
    AoR of relevant ATC Unit - CTA/UTA, TMA, CTR or individual control
    sector/s within an ATC unit), etc.) there are 3 (three) main types
    of restrictions:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  Not available for ...

> [Flight planning]{.underline} via restricted object [is
> forbidden]{.underline} for described flow(s).

b)  Only available for ...

> [Flight planning]{.underline} via restricted object [is
> allowed]{.underline} exclusively for described flow(s).

c)  Compulsory for ...

> [Flight planning]{.underline} via restricted object [is the only valid
> option]{.underline} for described flow(s).

3.  For the [combination of elements]{.underline} that define the flow
    of traffic, there are 2 (two) types of restrictions - inclusive and
    exclusive:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  INCLUSIVE restriction - traffic must meet [ALL]{.underline} of the
    conditions to be subject to the restriction. The implicit logical
    operator between the listed conditions is an "AND" - Logical
    Conjunction**.**

h.  The 2 (two) [combination of elements]{.underline} types might also
    be used alone or in combination.

```{=html}

5.  The term Requested FL (RFL) is used for RAD purposes and refers to
    the actual requested cruising level as specified in the ICAO flight
    plan field 15. Where it is used it shall be applied only to the
    State/FAB/ANSP in question unless otherwise specified. If a
    restriction specifies FL that is understood to be the flight level
    measured against IFPS calculated profile and is checked accordingly.

6.  Restrictions for the same restricted object (significant point, ATS
    route segment, defined DCT, airspace volume (ATC Unit, AoR of
    relevant ATC Unit -- CTA/UTA, TMA, CTR or individual control
    sector/s within an ATC Unit), etc) may be identified by more than
    one unique identifier. A single restriction should aim at containing
    all the flow elements that concerns a single operational goal or
    closely relation operational goals.

7.  State/FAB/ANSP restrictions shall be uniquely identified by a 6
    (six) digit alpha/numeric identifier which comprises the ICAO
    nationality letters for location indicators assigned to the State of
    origin or 2 (two) letter Regional / FAB naming convention prefix
    code, together with a 4 (four) digit number (LF2016, DU2001,
    RE2001). Exception from above rules is allowed for DCT
    identification in **Annex 3B** where a maximum 9 (nine) digit alpha/
    numeric identifier containing 5 (five) digit number might be used
    (LF50001, DU52345, RE54999, DSYX50000) and FUA Restrictions in
    **Annex 2C**.

8.  Cross-border (RAD) restrictions

9.  FUA restrictions Identification

> The FUA restrictions shall be identified as follows:

-   Restricted Airspaces Identifier (RSA ID) as published in State AIP
    followed by 1 letter R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y (LBTSA11R); or

-   Restricted Airspaces Identifier (RSA ID) as published in State AIP
    followed by 1 letter Z indicating FBZ existence followed by 1 letter
    R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y (LBTSA11ZR).

> *Note: In case of more than 8 FUA restrictions per RSA the NM RAD Team
> in coordination with relevant NRC/s and/or other NMOC Team/s is
> authorised to use other letters starting with Q on reversed order (Q,
> P, N, M, etc. with no use of letters "O" and "I").*
>
> When more than one FUA restriction is used for same RSA, the last
> letter shall be assigned based on the following rules:

-   R - describes the most restrictive limitation/s in RSA availability;

-   S - describes the less restrictive limitation/s different from those
    under letter "R";

-   T, U, V, W, X, Y - same descending logic as for letter "S".

1.  Definition

> RAD restrictions, except if otherwise mutually agreed by the
> States/FABs/ANSPs, shall be categorized as being cross-border when
> they are referenced to:

a)  boundary significant point;

b)  ATS route segment or DCT starting from or ending at boundary
    significant point;

c)  cross-border ATS route segment via boundary significant point or
    cross-border DCT.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  The referenced significant point shall be located on common boundary
    between two adjacent airspaces. The concerned airspaces might be
    FIRs/UIRs or ACCs/UACs or CTAs/UTAs or FABs or combination of them.
    These airspaces shall not be inside the same FAB, if FAB prefix code
    is used in identification.

3.  Cross-border restrictions might be or might not be part of the
    relevant LoA. Clear explanation for that shall be given by the
    appropriate National RAD Coordinator (NRC) in Column "Operational
    Goal".

4.  For any State/FAB/ANSP restriction, not defined as cross-border and
    considered that has impact on adjacent State/FAB/ANSP clear
    explanation for that shall also be given by the appropriate National
    RAD Coordinator (NRC) in Column "Operational Goal".

5.  Identification

> Cross-border restrictions shall be identified with an 8 (eight) digit
> alpha/numeric identifier as follows:

a)  twice ICAO nationality letters for location indicators assigned to
    the State followed by 4 (four)digit number (EGEB1009); or

b)  twice 2 (two) letter Regional / FAB naming convention prefix code
    followed by 4 (four) digit number (DUBM1001); or

c)  ICAO nationality letters for location indicators assigned to the
    State and 2 (two) letter Regional / FAB naming convention prefix
    code or vice-versa followed by 4 (four) digit number (LWBM1001,
    DULY1001).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  First two letters are identifying the State / FAB / ANSP performing
    the ATC action, while the second two letters - State / FAB / ANSP
    affected by that action**.**

7.  The Maastricht UAC restrictions are considered as cross-border and
    shall be identified as follows:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  inside AoR: ICAO nationality letters for location indicators
    assigned to the relevant State (EB, ED EH) and 2 (two) letters "YX"
    followed by 4 (four) digit number (EBYX1009);

b)  outside AoR: 2 (two) letters "YX" and ICAO nationality letters for
    location indicators assigned to the neighbouring State or 2 (two)
    letter Regional / FAB naming convention prefix code followed by 4
    (four) digit number (YXED1001, YXIU1002).

8.  Coordination

> Cross-border restrictions shall be coordinated between the NRCs of the
> States/FABs/ANSPs concerned BEFORE submission for inclusion in the
> RAD.
>
> Any cross-border restriction discovered by the NM RAD Team that has
> not been coordinated will be removed from the RAD until the
> coordination process has been completed.

11. Identifiers shall be assigned at RAD document as per tables below:

12. Where date/time ranges are used these shall be considered as
    INCLUSIVE. When time periods are expressed in column RESTRICTION or
    column UTILIZATION, restrictions are not applied outside those
    published times unless otherwise specified.

13. A restriction shall not qualify for inclusion in the RAD unless it
    has a FLOW ELEMENT attached to it. A FLOW ELEMENT is defined as
    affecting either:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Departures from an Airfield/Group/Area;

b.  Arrivals to an Airfield/Group/Area;

c.  Traffic flying between Airfields/Groups/Area;

d.  Overflying traffic.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  **Time periods**

    1.  The time periods are in Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) used
        by air navigation services and in publications issued by the
        AIS. The expression "summer period" indicates that part of the
        year in which "daylight saving time" is in force. The other part
        of the year is named the "winter period". Times applicable
        during the "summer period" are given in brackets. Daylight
        saving time is UTC plus 1 hour. The "summer period" in Europe is
        introduced every year on the last Sunday in MAR at 01:00 UTC and
        ceases on the last Sunday in OCT at 01:00 UTC. For detailed
        description in each State the relevant AIP shall be checked.

    2.  Details of weekend periods**,** if and when used are included
        where relevant. The start and end time of the periods relates to
        the entry to the segment concerned.

    3.  Additional periods can be declared as weekends (e.g. Busy
        Fridays, Nights, Bank Holidays), refer to national publication
        and relevant annex for the details.

    4.  To access data regarding Public Holidays pertinent to each
        State, refer to GEN 2.1 of the respective AIP.

4.  **Definition of limits expressed by FL**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The vertical limits shall be expressed as follows (ref. ERNIP Part
    1):

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  above the lower limit or minimum en-route altitude and below FL290 -
    VFR flight levels in accordance with ICAO Annex 2, Appendix 3, page
    1 (e.g. FL035 or corresponding altitude... FL285);

b.  above FL290 and below FL410 in RVSM areas - number representing the
    layer/ intermediate level between IFR flight levels ending on ..5
    (e.g. FL295 ...FL405);

c.  above FL410 or above FL290 in non RVSM areas - number representing
    the layer/ intermediate level between IFR flight levels ending on
    ..0 (e.g. FL420 ...FL500 ... ).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  **Expression of abbreviated words meaning Departure and
    Destination**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  In all Appendixes and Pan-European Annex, if and when used and
    required the expression of abbreviated words meaning Departure and
    Destination from/to certain airport/s or in/outside FIR/UIR /
    ACC/UAC / ATC Units shall be used based on ICAO Doc. 8400 -
    Abbreviations and Codes as follows:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  DEP - code meaning "Depart" *or* "Departure";

b.  ARR - code meaning "Arrive" *or* "Arrival".

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  **PERIOD OF VALIDITY**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The routeing organisation is permanently effective and applies daily
    H24, except where otherwise specified. When it can be identified
    that capacity is surplus to demand the RAD restrictions may be
    relaxed from the H24 time constraints.

2.  The RAD may be suspended, or temporarily relaxed, in cases where it
    has an abnormally adverse impact upon the traffic flows. This action
    will always be co-ordinated through the CDM process between the
    Network Manager and its Operational Stakeholders.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  **APPLICATION**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The RAD will be fully integrated into the Network Manager
    Operational systems, including IFPS, through the Route Restrictions
    computer model. Any changes to the Pan-European Annex will
    automatically be checked provided the relevant notification period
    has been observed.

2.  Changes agreed outside the AIRAC cycle will not be handled
    automatically by IFPS until such time as the system can be updated
    at the appropriate AIRAC date.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  **CDM PROCESS**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Amendments to the General Description of the RAD, or the period of
    validity, shall be co-ordinated between the Network Manager and the
    Operational Stakeholders via the RAD Management Group (RMG) and
    approved by NETOPS team. Inclusion or withdrawal of additional
    Annexes or Appendixes shall follow the same process.

2.  The Operational Stakeholders shall provide their request for changes
    to the NM RAD Team, taking into account agreed publication and
    implementation dates, in accordance with AIRAC procedures and
    Handbook Supplement for the Provision of Environment data.

3.  All new RAD restrictions, amendments and changes will be checked by
    the NM RAD Team versus airspace organisation in the area. Any
    possible discrepancies will be notified to the States/FABs/ANSPs
    concerned as soon as possible.

4.  Suspension of NAVAIDS, and/or replacement by temporary mobile units
    will be promulgated via the Pan-European Annex. States should ensure
    that the NM RAD Team is notified of these changes.

5.  The final content of any amendment to the RAD shall be positively
    agreed between the NM RAD Team and State/FAB/ANSP concerned. This
    agreement shall be reached in a form of e-mail confirmation, meeting
    report/minutes or any other means reflecting final mutual agreement
    for change. These agreements will be properly recorded by the
    Network Manager.

6.  Amendments will be published by the NM RAD Team as follows:

    a.  34 days in advance of the relevant AIRAC cycle;

    b.  Until the establishment of an automated RAD process amendments
        > will be highlighted in **RED**/**BLUE** **BOLD** and will be
        > annotated by abbreviation NEW/AMD;

    c.  Restrictions that have been removed will be annotated
        > abbreviation DEL;

    d.  "Last minute" changes:

-   are changes required due to exceptional circumstances and/or only
    when they have a significant impact on operational requirements;

-   shall be:

    -   announced by the NRCs as ordinary amended or new RAD
        requirements;

    -   exceptionally annotated as such;

    -   sent via e-mail to the NM RAD Team in accordance with ERNIP Part
        4;

-   will be promulgated on the NM NOP portal via the "Increment File".

-   will be announced by the NM RAD Team via e-mail to the Operational
    Stakeholders similarly as RAD distribution.

7.  **TEMPORARY CHANGES**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Temporary changes due to exceptional circumstances (e.g. major
    equipment failure, industrial action or large-scale military
    exercises) may necessitate the suspension of part of the RAD for
    specified periods, and additional routeings will be activated where
    possible following co-ordination with the relevant FMPs and AOs.

2.  Temporary changes will be published by AIM giving details of the
    traffic affected, the period of activation and the corresponding
    routeings.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
8.  **FLIGHT PLANNING**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The RAD defines restrictions on routes/points, through specified
    areas during the published period of validity. Aircraft operators
    planning flights through these areas must flight-plan in accordance
    with these route restrictions, taking into account any change of
    validity.

2.  When a route is restricted between two points it must be understood
    that all segments, between the recorded points, are included in the
    restriction.

3.  An operator who has submitted a flight plan for a route and wishes
    to change to another route must either; send a CHG (Change) message
    giving the new route or; cancel the existing flight plan and submit
    a new flight plan following the replacement flight plan procedure.
    This applies equally to re-routeing proposed by the Network Manager
    and to changes made at the initiative of the AO.

4.  When filing flight plans, AOs must comply with any flight level
    limitation published in the RAD. AOs shall be aware that when
    receiving the confirmed FPLs the FLs used are NOT checked against
    the Flight Level Orientation Scheme (FLOS) applied by the State
    concerned.

5.  AOs shall also be aware that when receiving the confirmed FPLs using
    DCT options from Appendixes 4 and 5 these flight plans are NOT
    checked against Minimum Sector Altitudes (MSA) or Minimum En-route
    Altitudes (MEA) published by the States in the relevant parts of
    their AIPs. In accordance with provisions of ICAO Doc 4444 - ATM
    (PANS-ATM) AOs remains responsible with the checking of MSA and/or
    MEA.

> *Note: Refer to IFPS User's Manual for full details.*

9.  **ROUTEING SCENARIOS**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  For each area expected to be critical, a number of flows could be
    identified, for which other routeings are available, that follow the
    general scheme, but avoid the critical area. These are known as
    routeing scenarios.

2.  When, during the planning phase, the Network Manager identifies the
    risk of major imbalance between demand and capacity, it may be
    decided, after agreement with all FMPs concerned, to make part (or
    all) of the alternative routeings mandatory for the period expected
    to be critical.

3.  Scenarios may be identified which require the temporary suspension
    of route restrictions within the RAD for a particular traffic flow.

4.  The list of available scenarios is promulgated on the NM NOP portal.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
10. **PUBLICATION**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The RAD is created in accordance with ICAO publication procedures
    and is published on the NM NOP website, 34 days in advance prior to
    the relevant AIRAC cycle.

2.  Each State may promulgate the RAD by any one of the following
    methods:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Publish the RAD in its entirety as an AIP Supplement (the onus is on
    > the State to ensure that the RAD is kept up to date);

b.  Publish relevant Appendices and State/FAB/ANSP part of the
    > Pan-European Annex of the RAD as an AIP Supplement;

c.  Publish reference to the NM NOP website in the AIP.

3.  Where applicable, publication of route availability in national
    aeronautical information publications shall be fully consistent with
    this common reference document.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
11. **TACTICAL OPERATIONS**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The Network Manager in conjunction with the FMPs will monitor the
    actual situation during the day of operation to ensure the RAD is
    achieving the balance of traffic required.

2.  During periods of unanticipated high demand the Network Manager may
    co-ordinate an extension to the period of validity of routeing
    scenarios with the relevant FMPs. This will be published by AIM,
    giving at least three hours notice.

3.  During periods of significant improvement to the ATFCM situation,
    the Network Manager will co-ordinate with the relevant FMP, a
    reduction in the period of validity of scenarios. This will be
    published by AIM.

4.  If, due to a major unexpected event, there is a significant
    disturbance to traffic patterns, after co-ordination with the
    relevant parties (FMPs and AO's), the Network Manager may suspend
    part of the RAD and provide alternative routeings.

5.  With effect from AIRAC -6 day (D -6), implemented RAD Data is
    considered as Operational. Management of such changes to the RAD is
    the responsibility of the NRC of the originating State

6.  If, after AIRAC -6 day (D -6), a State discovers an error or
    omission to the RAD that is SAFETY RELATED, then it is the
    responsibility of the NRC to contact the NM RAD Team to request a
    live update of the NM CACD in order to correct the problem. The
    safety related RAD error or omission shall be exceptionally
    annotated as such and shall be sent via e-mail to the NM RAD Team in
    accordance with ERNIP Part 4. The NM RAD Team will only act after
    consultation with the NRC or his designated Deputy. Following the
    consultation process the NM RAD Team shall create the necessary DMR
    and the change shall be promulgated via the "Increment File". During
    the weekend, the ACC shall contact the Current Operations Manager
    and the matter shall be handled MANually. A second alternative is to
    request that the restriction in question be DISABLED in ENVironment
    so that there will not be a check at IFPS.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
12. **RAD REVIEW**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The NM RAD Team is responsible for coordination of the entire RAD
    review process.

2.  The RAD review is required to ensure that all data contained within
    the RAD is current and correct. The review is also the opportunity
    to ensure that any modifications, within the incremental update to
    the Network Manager Operational systems, are reflected in the
    construction of RAD restrictions.

3.  A RAD review for each and every Annex/Appendix, including
    cross-border restrictions, shall be completed annually during
    designated meetings and as a rolling process by the NM RAD Team. The
    existing South West, South East, North West, North East or Ski -
    Airspace or ATFCM meetings could be used for RAD review purposes.
    Additional ad-hoc RAD review meetings could be organised in case of
    any urgent issues to be discussed.

4.  The outcome of each RAD review shall be properly documented through
    the report or minutes. The reports/minutes will be stored by the NM
    RAD Team.

5.  Each State**/**FAB/ANSP shall convene an internal RAD review with
    the airlines concerned. Such an internal review shall be announced
